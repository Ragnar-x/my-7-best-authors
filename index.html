			<h3>C.S. Lewis</h3>
			<p id="bio"><b>C.S. Lewis</b> was that rare mix of a deep thinker and a fantastic storyteller—the kind of guy who could debate theology in the morning and then spend the afternoon writing about talking lions and magical wardrobes. Best known for The Chronicles of Narnia, he introduced generations of readers to a world where kids become kings, witches fear Christmas, and beavers serve tea.</p>

			<h3>J.R.R. Tolkien</h3>
			<p><b>J.R.R. Tolkien</b> was the ultimate world-building nerd—the kind of guy who didn’t just write a fantasy story but invented entire languages, mythologies, and histories to go with it. Best known for The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, he basically created modern fantasy as we know it. If you love elves, epic quests, or brooding warrior types with secret royal blood, you have Tolkien to thank.</p>

			<h3>George R.R. Martin</h3>
			<p><b>George R.R. Martin</b> is like that brilliant, eccentric uncle who tells the best stories at family gatherings—but takes so long to finish them that you start wondering if you’ll live to hear the ending. Best known for A Song of Ice and Fire, the book series that became Game of Thrones, Martin built a fantasy world where heroes die, villains thrive, and no one is safe—not even your favorite characters (especially your favorite characters).</p>

			<h3>Fyodor Dostoevsky</h3>
			<p><b>Fyodor Dostoevsky</b> was the original master of existential angst—the guy who could turn a simple conversation into a philosophical crisis and make you question everything you thought you knew about human nature.</p>

			<article class="author-info">
			<h3>Donna Tartt</h3>
			<p><b>Donna Tartt</b> is the literary world’s cool, elusive enigma—the kind of writer who vanishes for a decade, only to reappear with a novel so meticulously crafted that it feels like she’s been hand-carving each sentence with a fountain pen dipped in ink made from pure atmosphere. Best known for The Secret History, The Little Friend, and The Goldfinch, she specializes in lush, obsessive storytelling where beauty and violence often go hand in hand.</p>

			<article class="author-info">
			<h3>Brandon Sanderson</h3>
			<p><b>Brandon Sanderson</b> is the human equivalent of a writing machine—except if that machine ran on pure creative energy and an unholy amount of plotting spreadsheets. Best known for The Stormlight Archive, Mistborn, and for heroically finishing Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time, he’s the guy you turn to when you want deep, intricate world-building and magic systems so detailed they probably have their own tax codes.</p>

			<article class="author-info">
			<h3>Andrzej Sapkowski</h3>
			<p><b>Andrzej Sapkowski</b> is the Polish mastermind behind The Witcher series, a gritty, morally complex world where monsters, sorcery, and politics intertwine in ways that’ll make you question if anyone in this universe is really a hero—or just someone with a better PR team. Sapkowski’s writing combines rich folklore, dark humor, and sharp social commentary, all wrapped up in stories that feel like they're set in a medieval Europe gone sideways.</p>
